 /**
     * Do While loop is post conditional check , first it will execute one time  then it will check condition
     * then if the condition is true then it will execute the statement or group of statement according
     * to conditional order , Means multiple times.
     * System.out.println(" Welcome to USA");    Assume Nested looping is the Parent an Child  Conditional statement , Looping
     * or iterating again again as long
     * condition is true , when  java start executing the coding  inside the parent Statement
     * as long it is true ,With in the parent's statement body first execute parent code immediately
     * one time if TRUE
     * then No matter what
     * jump to child statement as long as condition of child statement is true it will
     * continuously iterate, when False then exit from parent Statement
     * and start looping from parent statement , Start doing the execution as long Parent and
     * child condition is true
     * /**
     * * While loop is the pre Conditional loop
     * * while loop is used when we don't know how many times iterating or looping again and again
     * * while loop needs to be executed beforehand / means in advance
     * * Typically an Index are using when iteration or looping
     * * The Java do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times.
     * * If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once,
     * * it is recommended to use do-while loop. The Java do-while loop is executed at least once
     * * because condition is checked after loop body.
